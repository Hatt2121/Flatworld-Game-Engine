# Java Character Game Engine

This project is a simple text-based game engine built on the publicity of information. Its classes are never in private, as it  will always be better if someone knew what was going on in open source (*Especially if you want a good modding environment*).

## Graphics

Who needs graphics when there are such things as characters!

## Worlds, Boards, and Tiles

There is a heirarchy among the classification of the environment Worlds, Boards, and Tiles. The World is a collection of Boards, which is a collection of Tiles. Generally, a player would only be able to see one board at a time, however there would be options to see the whole world, for instance. Tiles are the individual spaces taken up by players, blocks, items (or piles), and npcs.

## Modablity

The aim of this engine is modability, because it provides freedom that some engines don't provide. But obviously, the features that will be introduced will be aimed at a basic survival.
